# Model Customization File Specifications
This page describes the file formats needed to customize models in useeior.
This includes models with aggregation and/or disaggregation of target sectors, integrated hybrid models hybridized with process LCI data, mixed unit models (which contain physical flow data), and waste input-output models.


# Disaggreation and Aggregation .yml File Specification
Aggregating a sector requires only one .yml input file, while disaggregation requires a .yml input file and several .csv files to specify the disaggregation parameters. 
The disaggregation and aggregation files are assigned in a yml file based on the parameters shown below. Each file is a list, named based on the [Code/location](Model.md#sector-meta) of the sector to be disaggregated or aggregated to (e.g. `221100/US`)


## Disaggregation

| ---  | ---  | ---       | ---------   |
| OriginalSectorCode | str | Y | Code/location of the sector to be disaggregated |
| OriginalSectorName | str | Y | Name of the sector to be disaggregated |
| DisaggregationType | str | Y |  Can be "Predefined" for a uniform disaggregation or "User Defined" for a custom disaggregation with user-supplied inputs|
| SectorFile | str | Y | Pointer to a file containing [disaggregated sectors mapping](#disaggregated-sectors-format)  |
| MakeFile | str | N | Pointer to a file containing [make table allocations for disaggregated sectors](#disaggregated-table-format) |
| UseFile | str | N | Pointer to a file containing [use table allocations for disaggregated sectors](#disaggregated-table-format) |
| EnvFile | str | N | Pointer to a file containing satellite table data for [disaggregated sectors](#disaggregated-satellite-table-format) |

## Aggregation

| Item | Type | Required? | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---       | ---------   |
| Sectors | str | Y | Bracketed list of strings of the Code/location of the sectors to be aggregated, with the first item in the list being the main aggregation sector (i.e., where all sectors will be aggregated to).  |


# Disaggregation Table Specifications
Input disaggregation tables are in csv format with the fields shown below. The Disaggregated Table format applies to both the Disaggregated Make and Disaggregated Use tables. 

## Disaggregated Sectors Format
This .csv file is a crosswalk between the most relevant 6-digit NAICS codes and the disaggregated sectors.

## Disaggregated Table Format
These .csv files contain the input values required for the disaggregation of the Make and Use tables. One file is required for each table.  

Field | Type | Required? | Description |
-- | -- | -- | -- |
IndustryCode | string | Y | Code/location for industry. Values included in this column can represent the original industry code to be disaggregated; the new industry codes representing disaggregated sectors; or existing industries where an allocation for a newly disaggregated commodity is to be assigned.  |
CommodityCode | string | Y | Code/location for commodity. Values included in this column can represent the original commodity code to be disaggregated; the new commodity codes representing disaggregated sectors; or existing commodities where an allocation for a newly disaggregated industry is to be assigned.  |
PercentAllocation | numeric | Y | Percent of sector output dedicated to the newly disaggregated sector. This column represents the allocation value for the specific industry/commodity combination specified by the IndustryCode and CommodityCode columns. All values must be between 0 and 1, to represent the percent allocated to the specific industry/commodity combination. |
Note | string | N |  This column contains short text strings describing the allocation performed in each row. The text is intended to describe how the allocation value is used in the disaggregation. |

## Disaggregated Satellite Table Format
Matches [totals-by-sector](Model.md#totals_by_sector) but includes an additional field `SatelliteTable` indicating the satellite table to which each record applies.


# Hybridization File Specification
Model hybridization, e.g., with LCA data from unit processes is available via [Model Type: EEIO-IH](ModelSpecification.md#model-types).
This hybrid model type requires as input data normalized environmental and technical (i.e., supply chain) data.
Additional examples of integrated hybrid models can be found in the [Hybrid Input-Output (HIO) data repository](https://github.com/USEPA/HIO/tree/main/useeior).
